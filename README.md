DunderBands: Find Music you didn't know you wanted to hear.

DunderBands is a 'Guided Search Engine' that seeks out underrated underground albums that are considered masterpieces by immediate fans

We Are Living In A 'Golden Age' Of Musical Achievement

The reason a lot of people think Music today is bad is very simple.  They are listening to the wrong Music.  And that's not their fault.   They are consistently bombarded with people and institutions telling them what to like.

The inclusivity that the internet provides gives us unprecedented access to creative minds from all over the world.   New genres are being created because someone in Greece was influenced by an artist in Israel who listens to Metal bands from France.


DunderBands is set up to specifically seek out these hidden gems.  And you will be the one finding this Music.  These are albums that would never come up in any normal search result because not enough people know about them.

That's why my first decision when making DunderBands was to limit the view count to less than 10,000 views.   Another feature that brings everything together is that DunderBands pulls the first 100 comments regarding the album and searches for words like 'Fantastic'  'Amazing'  'Masterpiece'.   It then displays the entire comment above the found album.

Here is a sample of what I'm trying to do.

I've already started working on other very interesting features.  But I am more actively pursuing setting an API in my code written in Python so that React Native can access everything and I can finally get thing on a mobile device.  I've already got an account with AWS for a couple bots I run so I'll probably be hosting the backend server there at first.


How DunderBands Came To Be

DunderBands first started taking shape when I started answering more and more questions about Music on Quora.  I noticed a disturbing trend. 

    Why does music not seem to change?
    Why is most music forgettable?
    What's wrong with Music today?
    Why is Music getting worse?

Music is my life.  I listen to at least 2 or 3 brand new artists I've never heard of every single day.  There is so much Music in this world that it is literally impossible to listen to all of it in your lifetime.  Just think about that.  

This whole time I was under the impression that everyone else was enjoying this 'Golden Age' right along side me.  

At first I blamed them for being too lazy to actually make the effort to find good Music.   But then people actually started asking for help.  They truly had no idea where to find Music that wasn't being suggested to them by google or YouTube or being played over and over again on their local radio station.   

In my rebuttal to one question in particular I included a sincere offer for anyone to give me just a couple favorite artists and I would find Music for themthat they had never heard before and that they would cherish.  

The first girl that reached out was a Talking Headsfan.  She also loved 80's New Wave.

"My favorite song is “Flying” by  Living Color, which is fairly modern, but I’m a huge fan     of 1970’s folk  rock and 80’s new wave like The Fixx, Talk Talk and Thompson Twins. My  favorite band is The Talking Heads. I try to search for similar music  online but it seems more and more these days like it’s impossible. Three  years ago I discovered Brian Eno and The Eagles by searching up The  Talking Heads and I got hooked on those songs. Now when I try to find  similar songs, Google keeps taking me to “Vevo’s YouTube” with Miley  Cyrus and Katy Perry. I’m on-board with the idea of a better music  matching service, free or otherwise, all the way"

An hour after sending her a link to Carpenter Brut's Leather Teeth she responded.

thanks so much for the link - I’ve  never heard Carpenter Brut’s stuff before but I’m listening to it right  now and it has so many familiar sounds - it has me thinking of The  Styx, Pearl Jam, The Knack, so many other bands, it’s amazing! I’d love  to see a radio station play this stuff, it reminds me of the stuff I  listened to when I went camping as a kid. 

This reply had me grinning like a fool.  It made me so happy.  

I started answering questions more geared towards finding Music rather than bashing it. 

One person said something one day that stuck with me.  He said the Music I had recommended was something he "Didn't even know he wanted to hear."  

That's when the first thoughts popped into my head about what would eventually become DunderBands.  It started with a question.  "How are people supposed to search for things they don't know they want to hear?"

This seemed serious to me.  It seemed that everyone who didn't make a concerted effort to find good Music daily was going to be doomed to listen to whatever the radio told them to listen to.

I hadn't quite spread my programming wings yet.  I was still taking notes, watching tutorials and solving coding challenges.  But for the first time I had an idea for something that I thought would actually be useful.

I spent 12 hours creating a 'Proof Of Concept'.  That night I had it spitting out Music links that I would never have heard without it.  Music that I still listen to today.

After I saw what was possible I just kept moving forward.

I realize this isn't for everyone.  I know that my passion for Music is large and important.  Not everyone is like that.

But if you do love Music and you want to hear a portion of what's going on around the world, DunderBands will find you Music to love.  I can guarantee you that.

Oh right I keep forgetting.  I think I'm gonna go with Dunder Bands: A Rock Engine... which I REALLY liked at first but I dunno.  It's growing  on me.

Next update will be very soon.  Trying to get things organized to actually do something here.
